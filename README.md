# ACSL support in Atom


Add syntax highlighting to [ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification language)](https://frama-c.com/acsl.html) language in C comments starting with `/*@`


###Important Note:
This package does not actually implement ACSL's full grammar, only simple keywords and punctuation to help syntax highlighting.

###TODOs:
* Add snipets
* Add settings to ease indent
